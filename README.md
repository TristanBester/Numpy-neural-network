# Numpy-neural-network
A variable size neural network implemented with Numpy alone. Includes numerical gradient checking.

Note: All inputs must be column vectors
Example training data set, list = [coloumn vector input, label]:
test_data = [[[[1],[1]],0],[[[0],[0]],0],[[[0],[1]],1],[[[1],[0]],1]] 

I have created in-depth articles explaining all of the concepts implemented in this project as well as the mathematics behind them, such as backpropagation for example. To read the these articles visit my website: https://machinelearningjourney.com/
